CS-305 Portfolio Submission

  Artemis Financial is a financial consulting firm that develops customized financial plans for its clients, and the company requested a full vulnerability assessment of its web‑based software application to support its modernization efforts. The client needed stronger protection for sensitive financial data, secure communication channels, and assurance that the application could withstand current and emerging cyber threats. My assessment began by interpreting these needs and identifying the risks associated with unencrypted communication, outdated libraries, insecure configurations, and potential exposure to external attacks. Because Artemis Financial may interact with clients across regions and handle sensitive financial information, secure communications are essential for maintaining confidentiality, meeting regulatory expectations, and preventing interception or tampering. I also considered modernization requirements such as the use of open‑source libraries, evolving web technologies, and the need to align with industry security standards.
  During the vulnerability assessment, I applied the security areas from the process flow diagram to determine which aspects were most relevant to the application. This included communication security, cryptographic security, configuration management, dependency security, and error handling. The manual review revealed several vulnerabilities, including missing HTTPS enforcement, insecure or missing hashing logic, improper keystore handling, outdated dependencies, and configuration issues that could expose sensitive paths or weaken the application’s defenses. I documented each finding with its location in the code base and explained why it posed a risk. Static testing using the dependency‑check plugin further identified known CVEs in third‑party libraries, and I summarized each vulnerability, its severity, and recommended remediation steps based on industry guidance.
  The mitigation plan combined insights from both manual and static testing. I recommended enabling HTTPS with a properly configured keystore, implementing SHA‑256 hashing for data integrity, updating vulnerable dependencies, removing hard‑coded file paths, and ensuring the application runs on a full JDK to support secure cryptographic operations. These steps added multiple layers of security, following a defense‑in‑depth approach that strengthens the application at every level—from transport encryption to secure coding practices and dependency hygiene. To ensure the refactored code remained functional and secure, I tested the application over HTTPS, verified the checksum endpoint, reviewed logs for errors, and re‑ran dependency checks to confirm no new vulnerabilities were introduced.
  Throughout the project, I relied on tools and practices that will be valuable in future work, including Maven dependency management, static analysis tools, secure keystore configuration, and structured vulnerability assessment techniques. This assignment demonstrates skills that employers value, such as identifying and analyzing vulnerabilities, applying secure‑coding best practices, troubleshooting complex configuration issues, and delivering a functional, secure application
